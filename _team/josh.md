I've spent the past six years working in cybersecurity at a number of organizations. I've spent portions of that time doing manual network and wireless pentesting. I've also spent a few years as strategic advisor to companies large and small. More recently, I've worked to grow my own practice as a tester and advisor. I'm excited to be a part of Strategic Defense and am eager to partner with organizations to identify and help remediate security gaps. I am also proud to hold several certifications including my Project Management Professional, CompTIA Security+, and Offensive Security Wireless Professional.
