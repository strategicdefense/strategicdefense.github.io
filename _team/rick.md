Rick enjoys things that rust and run on diesel, and even though we jest that he embodies a modern-day redneck, he seamlessly transitions between constructing loaf sheds for horses and coding or hacking applications. Holding a degree in computer science from Washington State University, Rick boasts three decades of experience in the tech sector. His expertise encompasses coding and spearheading high-performance penetration testing teams, with a dedication to delivering exceptional value to clients and resolving their cybersecurity concerns. Whether tending to his farm on a tractor or pondering ways to enhance client cybersecurity, Rick remains deeply immersed in both worlds.
