Rick likes things that rust and run on diesel, often joking he is a "Hi Tech Redneck" - equaly comfortable building loaf sheds for horses as he is writing code or hacking applications. With a degree in Computer Science from Washington State University, Rick has been in the tech industry for 30 years, writing code and leading high performance penetration testing teams. He has a focus on providing outstanding value to our clients and helping them solve their cybersecurity issues. He can often be found on his tractor working on projects around his farm, while thinking about how to better protect clients from cybersecurity threats.
